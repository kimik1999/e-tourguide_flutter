  "script": "The War Remnants Museum is a war museum at 28 Vo Van Tan, in District 3, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. It contains exhibits relating to the First Indochina War and the Vietnam War.\n\nOperated by the Ho Chi Minh City government, an earlier version of this museum opened on September 4, 1975, as the Exhibition House for US and Puppet Crimes. It was located in the former United States Information Agency building. The exhibition was not the first of its kind for the North Vietnamese side, but rather followed a tradition of such exhibitions exposing war crimes, first those of the French and then those of the Americans, who had operated in the country as early as 1954.\n\nIn 1990, the name was changed to Exhibition House for Crimes of War and Aggression.In 1995, following the normalization of diplomatic relations with the United States and end of the US embargo a year before, the references to \"war crimes\" and \"aggression\" were dropped from the museum's title as well, it became the War Remnants Museum.",
